# MyFeedNotification

This programn is a little project to learn go and tdd, there is some issues in code style, but i choose to ignore then, and focus in learn the language
and in the test creation.

This programn just receive a rss url and get the last feed, notify it, saving the value of time of the last feed and not re notifying it
